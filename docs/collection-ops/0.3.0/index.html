<p>The CollectionOps library is a simple lightweight library that aims to make task of handling collections in javascript more functional. CollectionOps brings lazily evaluated operations that fit in with the core language as smoothly as possible. These operations also work on types other than just arrays! They work on any object type that implements the Iterable interface in JavaScript. This means that these operations work on Sets, Generators, and even custom iterables. Many of these operations are also applicable to infinite collections, such as a never-ending generator or custom Iterable.</p>
